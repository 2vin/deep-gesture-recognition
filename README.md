# deep-gesture-recognition
Open-source gesture recognition using deep learning

This repo contains the code for detecting hand gestures using deep learning.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository: https://github.com/2vin/deep-gesture-recognition
2. Install dependencies using - pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the command - python inf_gesture.py
4. In order to change camera index or video path, edit the 'VideoCapture' command in the file 'inf_gesture.py'

## Supported Gestures
We have open-sources this model with three supported gestures

## Results

This model can detect three of the above mentioned gestures under varying pose, lighting and rotation. Have a look at how it perfomed on realtime camera feed.
